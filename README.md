# 🫐 Blueberry Browser (Internal Memo: Project "Juice" 🧃)

**To:** All Staff  
**From:** The CTO  
**Subject:** Why we are going to crush Strawberry 🍓  

Listen up. Strawberry is out there raising $2B from X-Separator and B17Å to build a "better browser." Cute.

While they were busy making slide decks, we were busy shipping the future. We realized that to really compete, we didn't just need a browser; we needed a **proprietary AI agent** that surfs the web better than a caffeinated teenager. We know Strawberry has an agent, but we wanted to push the envelope. That's why we gave ours a **codegen sandbox** so it can write its own code to finish tasks. That is the Blueberry difference.

Here is what we built in the last sprint. Let's show them what we've got.

## 🚀 Feature 1: The "Global Domination" Agent (Computer Use)

We built a computer-use agent from scratch. No prebuilt Gemini CU wrappers here - this is artisanal, farm-to-table code.

*   **👁️ Perception (The "All-Seeing Eye")**  
    We don't just "look" at a webpage; we dissect it. The agent performs a surgical **DFS (Depth-First Search)** on the DOM tree, indexing every single interactive element into a high-speed lookup map. We interpret the page using **Set-of-Mark** prompting, drawing bounding boxes so the agent knows exactly where to click. It uses minimal tokens, because we care about margins.

*   **🧠 Planning (The "Big Brain")**  
    The agent doesn't spam random clicks. It receives a **strategic plan** of subgoals. It checks the context, checks the plan, and executes. It's not just browsing; it's *operating*.

*   **🦾 Action (The "Hands")**  
    Powered by **Playwright** plugged directly into the **CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol)** mainframe. It navigates, types, and clicks with robotic precision. It follows a traditional **ReAct** loop (Thought → Action → Observation), but unlike the average intern, it actually stays on task.

*   **👻 Monitoring (The "Ghost in the Shell")**  
    We added a **ghost cursor** to the UI. You can watch the agent work in real-time. It's mesmerizing. It's also proof that it's working and not just hallucinating about electric sheep.

*   **🔮 Future Roadmap (World Conquest)**  
    Right now, the agent thinks in a straight line (Singly Linked List). Boring. We plan to upgrade its brain to a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. Then, we'll hit it with **Kahn’s Algorithm (TopSort)** to identify parallellizable tasks. Multitasking agents? Game over.

## 🛠️ Feature 2: The Logic Engine (Codegen Sandbox)

Why click buttons when you can write Python?

*   **⚡ Execution**: We gave the agent a terminal. Specifically, a secure **E2B sandbox**. It can generate and execute Python code to crunch data, parse files, or perform math that is too hard for LLMs.
    
*   **🧟 Persistence**: The sandbox doesn't die. It persists. It remembers. This allows the agent to reuse variables and state across multiple file operations. Efficient.
    
*   **📦 Artifacts**: The agent can forge new files or modify existing ones and hand them back to the user on a silver platter.

*   **🔮 Future Roadmap**:  
    *   **Polyglot Support**: Why stop at Python? Rust? Go? Assembly? 
    *   **Concurrent Sandboxes**: Spin up a dedicated sandbox for *every* user. Let them do deep data analysis in isolation. We'll call it "Blueberry Enterprise" and charge 10x for it.
